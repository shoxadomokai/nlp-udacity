# Lingu - Natural Language Processor

Lingu is a natural language processing website built on the Aylien web api.

The goal for this was to create a functioning frontend application using Node/Express and Webpack as part of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree.

## Instructions

### As a Developer

After cloning the repo, cd into the folder and run:

```shell
npm install
```

This will download all the dependencies you need to get the application working.

### As a User
